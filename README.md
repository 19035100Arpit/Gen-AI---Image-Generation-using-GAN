# GenAI: Face Image Generation using GANs (CelebA)
GenAI-CelebA is a deep learning project that showcases how to generate high-quality human face images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Built with PyTorch, this repository uses the CelebA dataset to train a GAN model capable of creating realistic celebrity face images from random noise.
# ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Implementation of Vanilla GAN / DCGAN

âœ… Trained on the CelebA dataset (aligned & cropped faces)

âœ… High-quality image generation of human faces

âœ… Real-time sample generation during training

âœ… Model checkpointing and resume support

âœ… Visualization of loss curves and generated images

âœ… Modular, clean, and extensible codebase

# ðŸ§  About GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) involve two models:

A Generator that learns to produce fake images.

A Discriminator that learns to detect whether an image is real or generated.

They train in opposition, improving one another until the generator produces highly realistic images.


# ðŸ“¦ CelebA Dataset
Over 200,000 aligned and cropped face images
